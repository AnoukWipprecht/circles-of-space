Circles of Space - Audiovisual Installation

<img src="http://vcovault.com/circles_of_space/circles-of-space.gif?" />

This project was a collaboration between Dutch designer Anouk Wipprecht and myself, presented at CODAME Art+Tech in San Francisco. The concept was to create an interactive visualization of personal space using a projector and sensors worn on the body.

Built for Chrome only!

Everything that you see in the visuals was created using CSS and JavaScript. I also created some ambient sound loops that correspond to the visual intensities.
